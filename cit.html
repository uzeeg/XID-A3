CRITICAL INTERFACE TOOLBOX
[AN ONLINE RESOURCE FOR CRITICAL INTERFACE DESIGN]

THE CRITICAL INTERFACE TOOLBOX unfolds as an online resource that exposes experimental methodologies, practices, and tools aimed at enhancing critical thought towards the actual configuration of the Interface. These actions were developed within a year-long research project at HANGAR. This initiative is part of the European Consortium IMAGIT and fits in with the research and actions developed at the Interface Manifesto.

[1] CRITICAL INTERFACE MANIFESTO
PROJECT WEBSITE >>

[1] The interface is a device designed and used to facilitate the relationship between systems.
[2] (To) interface is a verb (I interface, you interface ...). The interface occurs, is action.
[3] The interface exists in the crease between space and time; it is a device and simultaneously a situation. It is rendered (updated under thoughtful conditions) and emergent (joining into something new).
[3] The interface collects traces: traces and remains of all agents/agencies which converge in it.
[4] The interface is the tip of the iceberg of a complex system of agents/agencies, of interdependent infrastructures, codes, data, applications, laws, corporations, individuals, sounds, spaces, behaviors, objects, protocols, buttons, times, affects, effects, defects ...
[5] An interface is designed within a cultural context and in turn designs cultural contexts.
[6] The interface responds and embodies the economic logic of the system in which you enroll. It is a political device.
[7] The ideology of the interface is always embedded in the interface itself, but it is not always visible.
[8] Can we make the invisible visible? The more present interfaces are in our lives, the less we perceive them.
[9] The interface uses metaphors that create illusions: I am free, I can go back, I have unlimited memory, I am anonymous, I am popular, I am creative, it's free, it's neutral, it is simple, it is universal. Beware of illusions!
[10] The standard calls for a universal subject and generates processes of homogenization, but reduces the complexity and diversity . What is not standard?
[11] Users are entitled to know what the interface hides. Access to knowledge is a fundamental right.
[12] In the design of the interface, not only skills but also emotions and affections are deployed. How are emotions produced and circulated in interfaces?
[13] The user uses the interface perform agency, they coproduce each other and therefore they have the ability to define, redefine and contradict themselve by action or omission.



[2] A POETIC DECONSTRUCTION OF THE INTERFACE
WORKSHOP WEBSITE >>

This workshop sought to critically reveal, analyze and connect the complex network of agents that converge on the configuration of the Interface. During a 3 weekend-long workshop we revealed, deconstructed and re-articulated the material and immaterial elements that construct the Interface in order to reflect on its role and influence within the social, political, economic, cultural and emotional spheres of the networked society. Therefore, the main goal of the workshop was to stimulate and re-appropriate subjectivity, an essential process in the generation of critical thought about the true nature of technology, and in the imagination of alternative techno-paradigms which may coherently respond to our environmental and human conditions.





[3] TRACKING FORENSICS
WORKSHOP WEBSITE (COMING SOON) >>

Far from being a purely immaterial entity, the Internet is an extremely complex physical structure composed by a massive number of actors that have a direct and deep impact in every aspect of our daily lives. Despite its crucial role in many aspects of our society, the material and computational architectures that allow the Internet to exist are widely ignored by most of its users. Thus, this workshop seeks to critically reveal and analyze the complex network of agents that come together to configure the Internet, from submarine and underground cables to geopolitics, online tracking, surveillance and privacy. The workshop will strongly focus on uncovering and analyzing common online tracking practices used by major marketing and advertising corporations. To achieve this purpose, we will look into the forensics of the physical pathways of information, and will apply reverse tracking methods aimed at drawing a map of the many corporations that covertly access and commodify our data.
